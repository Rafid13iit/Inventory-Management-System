# --- Django Concepts Explained ---
# 1. **Django Project Structure**:
#    - A Django project typically contains multiple apps. Each app is a modular component
#      that handles a specific functionality (e.g., user authentication, blog, etc.).
#    - The `manage.py` file is the entry point for managing the project.

# 2. **Settings Module**:
#    - The `settings.py` file contains all the configuration for your Django project,
#      such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, and more.
#    - You can have multiple settings files for different environments (e.g., development,
#      production). Use `os.environ.setdefault` to dynamically set the appropriate settings.

# 3. **Virtual Environment**:
#    - A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment where you can install
#      project-specific dependencies. It prevents conflicts between dependencies of
#      different projects.
#    - Always activate your virtual environment before running Django commands.

# 4. **Management Commands**:
#    - Django provides built-in management commands like `runserver`, `migrate`, `startapp`,
#      and more. You can also create custom management commands for your project.

# 5. **Alternatives**:
#    - Instead of using `manage.py`, you can use `django-admin`, which is a standalone
#      command-line utility for Django. However, `manage.py` is preferred because it
#      automatically sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.

# 6. **Best Practices**:
#    - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in your project.
#    - Follow the Django coding style and conventions for better readability and maintainability.
#    - Use environment variables to store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials).
#    - Regularly update your dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities.

# --- Workflow ---
# 1. Create a Django project using `django-admin startproject <project_name>`.
# 2. Navigate to the project directory and use `python manage.py startapp <app_name>` to create apps.
# 3. Define models in `models.py` and run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply database changes.
# 4. Use `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server and test your application.
# 5. Add views, templates, and URLs to build the functionality of your app.
